Below is a list of online games that I've enjoyed and that have eaten away hours of my free time in past few years ðŸ˜…

## Word / language based
- [Wordle](https://wordlegame.org/) of course.
  - Polish version would be [Literalnie](https://literalnie.fun/).
- [Semantle](https://semantle.com/) you are not told which letters you got right, but how close your gues is semantically to the target word.
- [Pimantle](https://semantle.pimanrul.es/) similar to Semantle, but you see 2 dimensional vector space, which is a tad bit easier, because your guesses can be similar to the target word but *in a different way*.
- ### NYT games
	- [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) which I learned about thanks to Sofiane during ML4Good.
	- [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands), similar to *word search*, but you can connect letter more freely, you know how many words you're looking for, there's a theme, and you will use all the letters. Definitely easier than Connections.
## Trivia based
- [Redactle](https://redactle.anybrowser.org/) is the one I think I spent the most time playing, to the point where me & my friends tried to guess the answer in under 20 or even under 10 guesses. My personal record is 1 guess when it was the ["heat"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) article.
- Any game from [Trainwreck Labs](https://trainwrecklabs.com/).
- [Tradle](https://oec.world/en/games/tradle) (OEC trade data).
- [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/) where you guess a country by its outline.
## Logical
- [Nerdle](https://nerdlegame.com/). 
- [Nikoli](https://nikoli.co.jp) games.
