### Hi! I'm Jakub!

#### *From insights to impact* ðŸš€

I'm a product-oriented analyst, with generalist experience across design, finance, marketing and machine learning.

I'm active in the [AI safety](https://www.aisafety.com) area, [polish community working on it](http://aisafety.org.pl/), and the [polish Effective Altruism community](https://efektywnyaltruizm.org/).

I took the [Giving What We Can pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge) committing to donate 10% of my income to highly effective charities. I'm doing that mostly through [WiÄ™cej Dobra](https://www.wiecejdobra.pl/), an *effective giving* platform that I helped set up.
